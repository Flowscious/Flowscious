# Hello! 👋

    This GitHub account showcases my ongoing personal projects. I use Git, but I don't use GitHub 
    for my personal closed-source projects. If I ever release the source code for these projects, 
    this is the place where I will share the code.

## Ongoing Projects

Please visit 🌐 **[flowscious.com](https://flowscious.com/)** 🌐 to explore my official projects more directly.

I've created repositories for some of my ongoing projects. Many of these repositories are for project documentation, and again, if I ever release the source code, I will push it to the respective repository.

## My story 🍃

Before discovering coding, I composed and produced music by playing instruments, designing sounds, sampling audio, and building digital instruments. My focus was music and art, but as I got more interested in computers, I was introduced to `PineScript`. I dedicated my life to it, built my own trading indicators, and became a profitable scalping trader. Unfortunately though, I was cornered by Swedish tax laws and had to pay around **115%** in taxes. 

> ℹ️ **Explanation**   
> In Sweden, you can only offset up to 70% of your tax-deductible losses (as in my case). This means that if you win **1 000 000 SEK** and then lose **1 000 000 SEK**, you have to pay 30% tax on **300 000 SEK**. In other words, even though your profit and loss (PnL) is **0**, you will still incur a debt of **90 000 SEK**.  

My trading accounts looked great, but these harsh laws stopped me from proceeding altogether. 

At this point, I viewed the keyboard as my main instrument and started to build tax-calculating `python` scripts and delved deep into data analysis. I even plotted all my transactions in 3D, using self-made materials and a whole bunch of other interesting stuff!

After a while, I decided to expose **only some** of my previously unpublished indicators and sell them. This set me on a path to building my company independently and professionally.
